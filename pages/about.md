This site collects works published by Calabash: a Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters. Published by the New York University Graduate School of Portuguese and Spanish languages from 2000-2008, Calabash was dedicated to presenting the arts and letters of those communities long under-represented within the creative discourse of the Caribbean region, among them: Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, Maroon societies, and the Asian and Amerindian societies of the region. In addition, Calabash had a strong visual arts component.
