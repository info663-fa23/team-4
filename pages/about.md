## About Calabash: a Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters

This site collects works published by *Calabash: a Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters*, published by New York University's Graduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures from 2000 - 2008. The original Calabash website can be viewed on the [Internet Archive](
https://web.archive.org/web/20110701000000*/http://www.nyu.edu/calabash/).

Calabash was dedicated to publishing works encompassing, but not limited to, the Anglophone, Francophone, Hispanophone and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. It focused, in particular, on presenting the arts and letters of those communities long under-represented within the creative discourse of the Caribbean region, among them: Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, Maroon societies, and the Asian and Amerindian societies of the region. In addition, Calabash had a strong visual arts component.

In seeking to capture the essential essence of Calabash's mission on this site, we've created high-quality metadata for the individual artworks published in the journal. Users of this site can search and browse using typical elements like title, author, subject and genre as well as author nationality, which speaks to Calabash's emphasis on the breadth of the Caribbean diaspora and the centrality of Caribbean identity to the identity of the journal.
